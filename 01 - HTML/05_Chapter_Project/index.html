      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Lorem Ipsum is
        simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
        has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
        an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
        was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
        Ipsum.
